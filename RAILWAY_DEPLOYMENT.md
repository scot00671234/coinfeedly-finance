# Railway Deployment - Complete Guide

## 🚀 Deployment Status: READY

Your Coin Feedly financial news platform is now fully configured for automatic Railway deployment. Everything will deploy automatically when you connect your GitHub repository to Railway.

## ✅ What's Included

### Automatic Features
- **Database Auto-Setup**: PostgreSQL tables created automatically on first run
- **Sample Data**: Initial articles and market data seeded automatically
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API ready for frontend consumption
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring endpoint

### Railway Configuration Files
- `Procfile`: Defines the production startup command
- `railway.json`: Railway-specific configuration
- `nixpacks.toml`: Build configuration for Railway
- `server/production-entry.js`: Production server entry point

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

Set these in your Railway dashboard:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
```

Railway will automatically provide the DATABASE_URL when you add a PostgreSQL service.

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Connect to Railway
1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Create a new project
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Railway will automatically detect and deploy

### Step 2: Add Database
1. Add a PostgreSQL service to your Railway project
2. Railway will automatically set DATABASE_URL

### Step 3: Configure Environment
1. In Railway dashboard, go to Variables
2. Add: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. Save and redeploy

### Step 4: Deploy
Railway will automatically:
- Build your application
- Create database tables
- Seed sample data
- Start the production server
- Provide a public URL

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Database Schema
The system automatically creates these tables:
- `users`: User authentication
- `articles`: Financial news articles
- `market_data`: Real-time market information
- `news_events`: Raw news events for processing

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/health`: Health check
- `GET /api/articles`: List all articles
- `GET /api/market-data/gainers`: Top gaining stocks/crypto

### Production Server
- **Entry Point**: `server/production-entry.js`
- **Port**: Uses `process.env.PORT` (Railway provides this)
- **Static Files**: Serves from `dist/public` if available
- **Database**: Auto-connects using `DATABASE_URL`

## 🧪 Testing

The deployment has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Database auto-initialization working
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Production server stable
- ✅ Sample data seeding functional

## 📊 What Happens After Deployment

1. **Immediate**: Database tables created, sample data seeded
2. **Within 1 hour**: RSS feeds start pulling real financial news
3. **Ongoing**: AI-powered article generation using Gemini API
4. **Real-time**: Market data updates and article generation

## 🔍 Monitoring

- Health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
- Check logs in Railway dashboard for any issues
- Database status verified during startup

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- Health check returns `{"status": "OK", "timestamp": "..."}`
- Articles endpoint returns array of financial news
- Railway logs show "✅ Coin Feedly is ready!"

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
- Check PostgreSQL service is running
- Look for connection errors in Railway logs

### API Key Issues
- Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in Railway variables
- Verify the API key is valid and has quota
- Check logs for authentication errors

### Build Failures
- Repository should build automatically with included configuration
- Check Railway build logs for specific errors
- Verify all required files are committed to repository

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway dashboard logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure GitHub repository is properly connected
4. Test the health endpoint after deployment
