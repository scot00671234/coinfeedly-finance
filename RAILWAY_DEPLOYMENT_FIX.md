# Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue Resolution

The Railway deployment was not generating articles due to:

1. **API Key Configuration**: Fixed Gemini service to use correct environment variable (`GEMINI_API_KEY`)
2. **Production Server**: Updated Railway configuration to use correct production entry point
3. **Article Generation Timing**: Added startup delays to ensure database is ready before article generation begins
4. **Health Check**: Added required health check endpoint for Railway monitoring

## Fixed Files

- `server/services/gemini.ts`: Fixed API key resolution
- `railway.json`: Updated start command to use correct production server
- `server/index.production.ts`: Added health check endpoint and environment logging
- `server/routes.ts`: Added startup delays for article generation processes

## Railway Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in Railway:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (auto-provided by Railway)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google Gemini API key for article generation

## Result

Articles will now generate automatically every 20 minutes in Railway production environment.
